# lorem-ipsum

The lorem-ipsum project is a project that displays random paragraphs that i found from google :). When the page is loaded we have a number section and a generate button. The user chooses the number of paragraphs that he wants to display and clicks the generate button for example if he selects number 3 and clicks generate the website generates 3 paragraphs on the page if he selects 0 it doesn't display any paragraph etc. The maximum paragraphs that can be displayed are 9 if the user selects number 10 and above than the page will generate only 1 paragraph.
